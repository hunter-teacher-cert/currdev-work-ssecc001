I am currently using code.org. 

Both BJC and code.org use block codeing, howeveer code.org allows you to switch between block and text. 
They both have an intergrated curriculum that provides lessons for teachers to use in their classrooms. Code.org als provides lesson plans, slides and the worksheets needed for the lessons.
Code.org has automatic grading where I found using BJC it was difficult to see the students work unless there were right in front of you.
Both curriculums provide end of unit connections to ap classroom, however I feel that both require modifications in order to be more successful when preping for the AP exam.
I feel that both curriculums provide the students enough assistants for the create task but lack the rigour needed to prep for the AP exam. 
Code.org have a great survial guide for the create task.
