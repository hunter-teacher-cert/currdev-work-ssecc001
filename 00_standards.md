Data Analysis and Visualization
Data analysis is the process of cleaning, transforming,
organizing, clustering, and categorizing data to discover useful
information, draw conclusions, and aid in making decisions. Data
can be visualized in a variety of ways (including graphs and
charts) to aid in and communicate the results of the analysis

One of the lessons I have taught is CSP is filtering data. In this lesson, students will explore the challenges of working with a messy dataset. First students learn how to identify issues using the Data Visualizer, and then manually clean the data. Following this, students learn about the filtering tools in the Data Visualizer, and use a guided activity to answer data questions that require filtering a dataset.

Students will be able to:
Create filtered charts that answer specific questions
Explain why data needs to be cleaned
Use the Data Visualizer to filter data



Algorithms and Programming
An algorithm is a sequence of steps designed to accomplish a
specific task. Algorithms can be translated into programs, or
code, to provide instructions for computing devices. Algorithms
are central to programming. Programming is the process of
designing and developing code to perform a specific task. It
includes the transformation of an algorithm into a specific
language that a computer can read and execute, testing code
under controlled conditions to ensure its accuracy, debugging the
code to resolve errors, and producing documentation both for
end users to understand how to use the program and for other
developers to assist in following the logic within the program. 

Another lesson that I teach is on algorithms Efficiency. In this lesson students follow a demonstration of Linear Search before writing their own search algorithms. Following this, students are introduced to Binary Search after which they compare graphs of the search algorithms to determine which is most efficient.

Students will be able to:
Compare the efficiency of Linear Search and Binary Search
Use Binary Search to determine if a number is in a list
Use Linear Search to determine if a number is in a list
