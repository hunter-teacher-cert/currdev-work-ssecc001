For my Computer Science class we are currently using Code.org. The tools provided are lesson plans, curriculum, pacing calendars and automatic grading system. 
With code.org I am able to track if students completed a specific assignment. They use bubbles to indicate the different lessons. If the bubbles are filled in, it means they are completed. Code.org has a great platform for student to write thier code and create apps. They have an app lab, sprite lab and a game 
lab. Here student can create different projects.

I use google classroom to provide students notes.  I use google slides and digital manipulatives that help students understand knew topics. I also post assignments and their grades uses the different platforms google classroom has.
