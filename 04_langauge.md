What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
10th grade no coding skills required. Knowing block base coding like scratch would be beneficial. 

What is the language?
Python
How does one write & run code in this language?
coding can be done in platforms like codeskulptor, or can be directly in project stem.
Rate the complexity of the syntax?
Python syntax is one of the less complex in comparison to other text base languages such as JavaScript and java.
Strengths
- Among the easiest text-based languages to learn
- Great beginner class for students who have no coded before.
- Ear sketch to make movies
- Make graphics 

How would you utilize the strengths in the class?
Create projects that involve graphics to make the course more exciting for students.
Weaknesses
There is still syntax that needs to be followed since it is a text-based language and can't be switched to block.
How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Practice indentations 
Why did you select this language for this class?
Python is one of the most used languages in tech companies. I think it is an important still for students to have. Since I currently teach CSP. 
Students who already know python will be more at an advantage.
